little tweaking to the “pizza spins,” trying to get a better handle on
how animations actually work. zillion degree weekend in toronto and
many patios equals a very tired brain.

i learned about 20 ways that don’t work for how to make something
“bounce,” but i’ll try again in a day or two. in meantime, a spinning
doughnut feels very soothing to gaze upon.
